# Change Active/Owner Key

An EOS account can have multiple keys associate with it. Each key allows a certain permission to the account it is attached to.

It is a recommended safety measure to create both an **Active** and **Owner Key** for your EOS account in the case that your Active Key becomes compromised as actions can be taken via your Owner Key to limit access to the hacker.

An **Owner Key** allows you Owner permission to your EOS account. As the name dictates, having the Owner Key means you have ownership of the account. There are very few transactions that require you to use your Owner Key and you should not be using it on a regular basis for daily transactions.

An **Active Key** allows you to set restricted permissions and can be used for transferring funds, voting, and making other account related changes.

It is important for you to always keep your keys safe. Exposing your Owner Key may lead your account being compromised. Never share your Owner Key with anyone.
