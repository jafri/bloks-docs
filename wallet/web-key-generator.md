The icon next to the keys allow you to copy the key quickly. Click Generate New Keys if you would like a different key paring. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
The safest way to generate and keep your key pairing is if you generate them while offline and create a paper wallet. Bloks.io does not have this service available but you are able to use our tool, EOSKEY.io, to generate keys offline.
