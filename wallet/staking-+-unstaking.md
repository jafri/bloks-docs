# Stake CPU / NET

With EOS, you are able to stake or unstake it. Staking means you are locking down your tokens to give you access to resources \(CPU and NET\) that you need to perform actions on the blockchain. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
The process of unstaking your EOS takes a **total of 72 hours** from the moment you click unstake to when you will have full access to move the EOS. This is a security feature to add a three-day buffer incase your keys may be compromised. Staking your EOS can add this layer of security for your account.  
{% endhint %}
