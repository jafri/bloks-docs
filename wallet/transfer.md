# Transfer

EOS's DPOS consensus mechanism allows free, quick and easy transfers between accounts. Bloks' wallet functions allow users to transfer tokens in 3 easy steps.

## HOW TO TRANSFER

### 1. Select **Wallet** on the top menu.

The Transfer Token page has 3 fields for you to fill in;

* **Send To** - Username to receive tokens.
* **Amount** - Amount of tokens to send to the receiver. Clicking on the blue button on the right will display a drop down list of all the tokens you own on the account.
  * Selecting **Use custom token** will allow you to manually enter the **Symbol of token** \(e.g. EOS\) and **Contract of token** \(e.g. eosio.token\)
  * You can select **Send entire balance** to autofill the amount.
* **Memo \(optional\)** - You can send a memo with your transfer. 

### 3. Click on the "Transfer _AMOUNT_ to _USERNAME"_ blue button to complete transfer.
