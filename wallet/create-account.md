# Create Account

To interact with the blockchain and use dApps on EOS, you will need to have an EOS account. The account will store your data on the blockchain such as your account name, transfers, and how many tokens you own.

A new EOS account can **only be created by someone with an existing accounts on Bloks.io**. You will need to stake a minimum of 0.2 EOS for NET and CPU to allow a few transactions, as well as a minimum of 3000 bytes of RAM.
