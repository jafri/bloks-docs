# Vote for Referendums

The referendum system is in place on EOS mainnet for token holders to voice their opinions. Anyone with an EOS account can create a proposal, and if it meets the thresholds, it will be passed and executed. The three thresholds are;

1. A minimum of 15% of all tokens that have been issued must vote on the proposal
2. At least 55% of all votes must be cast for Yes 
3. Sustain both of the above thresholds for 30 consecutive day

As a token holder, you are entitled to state your opinion and vote on proposals and 1 token will equal 1 vote. You are allowed to vote for as many proposals as you'd like, and you are also able to leave a comment with your vote. 

EOS Canada has an excellent FAQ for everything related to the EOS Referendum Contract [here](https://www.eoscanada.com/en/answers-to-every-question-you-have-about-the-eos-referendum-contract).
