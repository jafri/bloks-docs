# Vote for Referendums

The referendum system is in place on EOS mainnet for token holders to voice their opinions. Anyone with an EOS account can create a proposal, and if it meets the thresholds, it will be passed and executed. The three thresholds are;

1. A minimum of 15% of all tokens that have been issued must vote on the proposal
2. At least 55% of all votes must be cast for Yes 
3. Sustain both of the above thresholds for 30 consecutive day
